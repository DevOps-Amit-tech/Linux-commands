Distros nothing but distributions are specific group of software
In all linux distributions:
* Linux kernel is same (mostly).

Few companies take the linux kernel and put up some modified version of their software on top of it and launch their own distributions of linux. They govern all the things like updation of the software, package repository, release of the new security patches etc.

Companies that are launching these distros are: Arch | Debian | Red hat | Slackware etc
Below mentioned are flavors of the above mentioned distributions
Debian	=>	Mint, kali, Ubuntu, Parrot, Deepin 
Red hat	=> 	Fedora, Centos (Community Enterprise Operating System), RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux)

### 7. Commands in linux:
Linux commands are simply programs which are executed by the shell. In linux there are thousands of commands. Sometimes the command which you are executing may not be available in your OS. In that case download & install required package from respective repository (like apt, yum) and then execute.

**Ex:**
"command not found" error while executing tree command
tree is a command which is available in tree package. Download tree package and then execute that command

### 8. Installing softwares/packages:
In Linux, installation files are distributed as packages. A repository is a storage location from which your system retrieves and installs OS updates and applications. It is like a warehouse that consists of all packages.

**Ex:** Inorder to install a package in ubuntu
1. update the repository			                It will update/install dependent packages   apt-get update                    
2. Download & install the required package		It will install actual software             apt-get install <package-name>

Likewise "yum" is a repository for CentOS, "apk" is a repository for Alpine, etc
